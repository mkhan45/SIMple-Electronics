This folder is just for generating shape SVGs using <https://pypi.org/project/svgwrite/>

As it turns out I got most of the SVGs from Wikipedia where user Inductiveload has generously published them to the public domain. I've edited each SVG to suit the project.

The XOR and XNOR SVGs are GPL licensed by Wikipedia user Chris Martin.
